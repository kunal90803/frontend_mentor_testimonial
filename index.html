              "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a 
              line of code. I needed some structure from professionals 
              who can help me learn programming step by step. I was 
              encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who 
              can only say wonderful things about the program. 
              The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. 
              They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long 
              for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, 
              was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level 
              in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've 
              often referred to it during interviews as an example of 
              my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a 
              job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommend!"</p>
